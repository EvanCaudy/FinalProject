			<p style="text-align: center;">

				<p>The endgame is one of the most important aspects to the game of chess. Knowing your endgames and if you're winning in endgame will help all aspects of chess, because it will help you know the right trades and when to trade. Having superior endgame knowledge than your opponent can help you turn a seemingly drawn position into a winning position. The endgame starts when most if not all of the minor and major peices are traded, often leaving only the opposing kings and pawns on the board.</p>
				<p>If any pieces are left on the board, activity becomes much more important. Making your enemy's pieces passive gives you a massive advantage when it comes to winning the game.  Putting your rook behind your pawns to push them down the board is also a great strategy.</p>
				<p>Now that the board is mostly clear, it actually is safe to bring your king out to help escort pawns. In fact, it is essential! On the same not, cutting the opponents king off and making it passive is the best way to attempt to promote your pawns.</p>
				
				<h2>ENDGAME CHECKMATES</h2>
				
				<p>Knowing basic checkmates with the king and queen, or the king and rook is very important to being able to win games. It will also be able to help you mate quicker and waste less time, or allow you to confidently move your pieces in time trouble.</p>
				<h3>Rook and King:</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="expand" src="Images/rookkingmate.jpg" alt="Classic rook and king mate"></p>
				<p>In order to mate with the king and rook you have to cut off the opponents king with your rook. For example, if the enemy king is on e2 and your rook is on a8, the best move in the position is to play Ra3, cutting the king off on the second rank. Your next moves should be to bring your king close to the enemy king. Then you can force your opponent to move into opposition where you can slide your rook down, forcing the enemy king back a rank. In the previous position, imagine your king is on d4. With your opponent to move, if they played Kd2 that would play right into our hands where we would play Ra2, forcing the king onto the first rank where we will play Ke3 once again forcing our opponent to eventually face opposition with us where we will mate them like the picture above.</p>
				
				<h3>Queen and King:</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="expand" src="Images/queenkingmate.jpg" alt="Classic queen and king mate"></p>
				<p>Mating with the queen is easier than the rook because the queen can do most of the work by herself. Firstly, cutting the opponents king off is still the first thing you need to do. Then place your queen a knights move away from the king, forcing it to either back up or move back a row. If they move back a row you simply cut them off again and repeat the process. Otherwise you move your queen down one square back into a knights move away where eventually you will force them to give up that row and you can force them to the side of the board. This is where you will need to be carefull, when your opponents king is at the very corner of the board, if you move your queen a knights move away it will result in stalemate! When the king goes to the very corner of the board you will place your queen one square back from a knights move away, leaving only 2 leagal squares for the king. Then you can simply bring your king over and mate with the queen.</p>
				
				<h2>ENDGAME POSITIONS</h2>
				<p>Knowing how to win in certain positions or draw a seemingly lost position will take you miles in becoming a better chess player, so here is 2 basic endgame positions everybody should know.</p>
				<h3>Lucena Postion:</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="expand" src="Images/lucenapos.jpg" alt="Classic lucena position"></p>
				<p>In this position you are ready to make a queen and mate your opponent, but if you rush to quickly you will find that your opponents rook checks are extremely effective at preventing the making of a new queen. The way you win this position is by first checking the opponents king with Rf2. The natural Ke6 loses immediately to Ke8, where your opponent cannot prevent you from queening. If they try Ra8+ you just queen anyway and you are up a queen with mate coming soon. If they take the queen then you can just execute the rook and king mate shown above. So since Ke6 fails, the best move for black is Kg6, now you do whats called, "building a bridge" and you play Rf4. Now the best plan for black is to just wait around, something like Rb1. Basically no matter what they do you play Ke7. If they check you with Re1+ you play Kd6. If they continue checking you with Rd1+ then you play Ke6. Now if they check you you have Kd5, where if they check you again you can cover with your rook, allowing you to queen. After you play Rf4 if they play the absolute best move Re1, preventing Ke7, you can play Kc7, which will transpose into the same thing if they keep checking you.</p>
				
				<h3>Philidor Position:</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="expand" src="Images/philidorpos.jpg" alt="Classic philidor position"></p>
				<p>The main point here is that you want to get your rook to the third or sixth rank and wait. Sometimes waiting can be the hardest thing to do in an endgame, but it is often essential to winning or drawing. Waiting means not trying to make progress, and waiting for your opponent to make a move that makes their position worse. In the case of the Philidor, both sides will wait eternally and it will be a draw. So how do you wait? You move your rook back and forth along the third or sixth rank. In this scenario, your opponent should do the same. If the player with the extra pawn ever gets tired of waiting and tries to advance the pawn, the key to a draw is to move the rook to the first rank and check from behind. Because the pawn will have advanced too far, the king can no longer get shelter.</p>
